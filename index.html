<h1>Bangladesh country profile</h1>
<img src="img/images.jpg">
 <p>Bangladesh is one of the poorest and densely populated countries in the world. It is located in South Asia and is bordered by India from three sides, Burma from the southeast corner and the Bay of Bengal from the south.

In order to combat the plague of corruption, numerous political leaders were arrested on various and diverse charges without going to court since these actions are allowed during an emergency. People welcomed the caretaker government backed by the army with open arms and their actions and decisions were applauded by most members of the upper and middle classes and many members of the lower classes. However, at the end of two years, one must ask, to what extent were the cases followed up in court and also how have these ‘accomplishments’ benefited the political process. The same two leaders who were shamelessly arrested in the second half of 2007 on grounds of corruption ran for the election in December last year, and one was even elected as Prime Minister. Unlike the U.S. and many other countries, an individual is allowed to run for election for more than two terms and it can be argued whether</p>
